### Instructions:
1. Save the above code in a file named `query_handler.py`.
2. Create a query file named `query.txt` with the desired query.
3. Ensure you have a data file (e.g., `sample.csv`) in the same directory.
4. Run the script with the command:
   ```bash
   python query_handler.py
   ```

The script will read the query from `query.txt`, process it, and print the results to the console.
